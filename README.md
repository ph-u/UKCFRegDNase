We know a medication group "xx" has a distinctive segregation with the rest of the "data sufficient" medication options.  This repository holds scripts to untangle further medications which were grouped into "others" in the previous analysis.  This provides insight onto three medications "Beta agonists", "deoxyribonucleases" (or DNAse) and "mucolytic chemicals".
